	\subsection{General Security}% NOTE: Proofread and shortened
	\label{sub:general_security}

	% \cite{Grau:2015:Ctyf} % Fridge and more % magazine article. nothing new here, good to make non-scientists aware of the issues though.
	% \cite{Bhartiya::YSFMK} % Fridge and more % online article. nothing new here, except the idea that a fridge or freezer could be used for murder.

  It is widely known that IoT devices have poor security in general.
	The most recent state-of-the art security survey was performed by
	Zhang~et~al.~\cite{Zhang:2017:UISTDCBWWNaWWG} % General
	They provide a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities and defence mechanisms.
	In particular, they note that much academic literature is overly conservative because most security analyses are published in whitepapers and on blogs, causing them to be ignored in scientific surveys.
	They suspect either a lack of expertise, or outright neglect of security design on the part of the vendors.

	Additionally,
	Restuccia~et~al.~\cite{Restuccia:2018:SITNPaRC} % General
	recently provided a very good analysis and taxonomy of the systematic problems and future challenges of IoT security. The paper strongly advocates for security by design of connected devices from their cradle to their grave.

	\subsection{Smart Light Security}% NOTE: proofread and shortened.
	\label{sub:smart_light_security}
	The security of smart light systems is particularly important because of their ubiquity. Hence, researchers have studied them in detail.
%	The security of smart light systems is of decisive importance since smart light solutions are also used in public buildings and offices. Hence there are several former studies analyzing the security of IoT light bulbs~\cite{Dhanjani:2013:HLSEPHPWLS, Morgner:2016:AYBBUICSSCLS, Ronen:2018:IGNCZCR}.

	% Light bulbs
	Dhanjani~\cite{Dhanjani:2013:HLSEPHPWLS} found several ways to initiate \textit{Denail-of-Service}~(DoS) attacks.
	He was able to cause sustained blackouts which can be of high risk i.e.\ if hospitals are involved.
	The primary security issue allowing this attack lay in the connection of smart bulbs to their controller.
	Dhanjani also mentioned the possibility of encryption flaws in the implementation of the \textit{ZigBee Light Link}~(ZLL) which is used for communication between the bridge and the light bulbs. However, this attack would only work within close proximity, limiting it's impact.

	% Light bulbs & ZLL
	Morgner~et~al.~\cite{Morgner:2016:AYBBUICSSCLS} further investigated the security of ZLL and showed that the aforementioned attack is more dangerous than anticipated.
	They were able to control ZLL-certified light bulbs from a distance over 15 to 36 meters.
	Their research proved and particularized Dhanjani's~\cite{Dhanjani:2013:HLSEPHPWLS} findings that exploitable vulnerabilities exist in the design of the ZLL standard.
ZLL provides the so-called \textit{touchlink~commissioning} which uses a global ZLL master key to secure the setup process.
This master key was leaked in 2015~\cite{Morgner:2016:AYBBUICSSCLS} and ever since the touchlink procedure is considered to be insecure.
Due to the flaws in the touchlink specification Morgner~et~al.\ were able to introduce a new network key which was then accepted by all connected light bulbs, further allowing the authors to send malicious commands.

	% ZLL
	Ronen~et~al.~\cite{Ronen:2018:IGNCZCR} also used flaws in ZLL to attack smart light solutions.
	Their attack was of even higher concern since they were able to exchange the light bulbs firmware with one containing malware, and, because of vulnerabilities in the ZigBee communication, they were able to further spread the malware over all nearby light bulbs.
	Thus, an attacker would be able to launch a \textit{war-flight} and infect all smart lamps of a whole city.

	\section{Functionality-Ignoring Attacks}% NOTE: proofread and shortened. Not sure we should keep it though!
	\label{sec:functionality_ignoring_attacks}
	% Focus on botnets for spam, ddos
	A big portion of the research on IoT security was conducted about attacks ignoring the intended functionality of IoT devices. In particular, the appearance of the Mirai botnet led to multiple papers about botnets comprised of IoT devices.

	Angrishi~\cite{Angrishi:2017:TitiiiviIb} % botnets
	makes the very important point that IoT devices should not be seen as specialized devices with added intelligence, but rather as (general) computing devices that are performing specialized tasks.
	Attackers are certainly aware of this, and most attacks on IoT devices involve botnets for DDoS or spamming. DDoS-capable malware was surveyed and classified by Donno~et~al.~\cite{Donno:2017:ADIM}.

	The most comprehensive analysis of the Mirai botnet, responsible for the record-breaking 1.3Tb/s DDoS on DynDNS, was published by
	Antonakakis~et~al.~\cite{Antonakakis:2017:UMB}. % Mirai
	In particular, they found a list of default passwords found in the source code of the malware, which clearly show it targeting cheap IoT devices, many of them IP cameras.
	They clearly show that Mirai succeeded primarily because of incredibly low-hanging fruit: (tiny) dictionary attacks on devices accessible from the open internet were enough.

	% \cite{Kolias:2017:DIMaOB} % botnets % removed because strictly inferior to Antonakakis:2017:UMB

	\section{Functionality-Extending Attacks}% NOTE: proofread and shortened.
	\label{sec:functionality_extending_attacks}
The most interesting kind of attack is the so called \textit{Functionality-Extending~Attack} where e.g.\ an attacker uses an IoT lightbulb for other purposes than illumination.
	In particular, an attacker can use light~emitting~diodes~(LEDs) for an optical wireless communication system, which was elaborated several years ago~\cite{Komine:2004:FAfVLCSuLL, Elgala:2007:OVLWCBoWL}. % TODO: maybe add a sentence about PWM duty cycle here?
	Since smart light solutions use LEDs, Ronen~and~Shamir~\cite{Ronen:2016:EFAIDCSL} were able to create a covert communication channel using smart lights.
	As the setup process of an IoT light bulb is vulnerable~\cite{Dhanjani:2013:HLSEPHPWLS, Morgner:2016:AYBBUICSSCLS, Ronen:2018:IGNCZCR}, Ronen and Shamir were able to abuse the \textit{application~programming~interface}~(API) of the IoT light bulb in order to make the LEDs switch between two light intensities at a very high rate, such that it cannot be noticed by the human eye but can be detected by a light sensor. % TODO: Not sure about that sentence. The setup vulnerability is more of an added problem, no?
	% The core issue is that the LEDs can change brightness faster than 60Hz, which shouldn't be necessary or allowed (c.f. the fact that newer HUEs cannot flicker very fast).
	% The other attack directly measured the PWM duty cycle, nothing can be done about that. That's why the second attack would still work.
	The light sensor measures the exact duration and frequency of those flickers and converts it to a digital frequency in order to leak sensitive data.
	Ronen and Shamir showed that this kind of attack can be used to extract data from air-gapped networks.
	Besides leaking data through a covert channels, they have shown that the light flickering can also be misused for creating epileptic seizures.
