%% the default behavior of creating a titlepage every time a \section{} is defined.
%% Then you can use \section{} as it's originally intended, including a table of contents.

%% Table of Contents, if wanted:
%% this requires the 'nosectiontitlepage' option and setting \section{}'s as you want them to appear here.
%% Subsections and subordinates are suppressed in the .sty at the moment, search
%% for \setbeamertemplate{subsection} and replace the empty {} with whatever you want.
%% Although it's probably too much for a presentation, maybe for a lecture.

% Need to think about whether we want to cover LimitlessLED/LUX old/LUX new or only one of them!
% --> it's hard.. I'd say LimitlessLED since PWM signal analysis can be done more easily (according to paper), and there are known setup vulnerabilities (if we use the same version), BUT we'd then have less intensity values which will make it harder creating a real covert channel - BUT 3 top brightness levels of LimitlessLED are the same, so maybe those levels can be used in order to keep channel covert - so I'm not sure about that thought
