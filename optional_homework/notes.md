## a
- Initiate connection with the card directly
- MITM, but is this protocol-level?

## b
Include authentication of the automatic gate to prevent MITM.

## c
Power analysis can give an exponent as long as S&M is used.

# 3

## a
Yes, because two repetitions mod p & mod q are asymptotically faster than one repetition mod pq.

## b
TODO!

# 4

## a
$\frac{5!}{2}$
--> 120, so ~60 on average

## b
if only one of the keys is dusted, it's position can be fixed by counting how many other keys are contaminated.

if it's the first or last key, 4! combinations, so 24 --> 12 on average
if it's in the middle, 2 * 2! combinations, so 4 --> 2 on average
if it's second or fourth, the last one is known as well, 3! combinations, so 6 --> 3 on average

## c
operator
- cover the keypad to protect it from pollen
- introduce time-outs after failed attempts

user
- wipe the entire keypad
- use a different finger for each number
