@article{Ronen:2018:IGNCZCR,
	abstract = {Within the next few years, billions of IoT devices will densely populate our cities. In this paper we describe a new type of threat in which adjacent IoT devices will infect each other with a worm that will rapidly spread over large areas, provided that the density of compatible IoT devices exceeds a certain critical mass. In particular, we developed and verified such an infection using the popular Philips Hue smart lamps as a platform. The worm spreads by jumping directly from one lamp to its neighbors, using only their built-in ZigBee wireless connectivity and their physical proximity. The attack can start by plugging in a single infected bulb anywhere in the city, and then catastrophically spread everywhere within minutes. It enables the attacker to turn all the city lights on or off, to permanently brick them, or to exploit them in a massive DDOS attack. To demonstrate the risks involved, we use results from percolation theory to estimate the critical mass of installed devices for a typical city such as Paris whose area is about 105 square kilometers: The chain reaction will fizzle if there are fewer than about 15,000 randomly located smart lamps in the whole city, but will spread everywhere when the number exceeds this critical mass (which had almost certainly been surpassed already). To make such an attack possible, we had to find a way to remotely yank already installed lamps from their current networks, and to perform over-the-air firmware updates. We overcame the first problem by discovering and exploiting a major bug in the implementation of the Touchlink part of the ZigBee Light Link protocol, which is supposed to stop such attempts with a proximity test. To solve the second problem, we developed a new version of a side channel attack to extract the global AES-CCM key (for each device type) that Philips uses to encrypt and authenticate new firmware. We used only readily available equipment costing a few hundred dollars, and managed to find this key without seeing any actual updates. This demonstrates once again how difficult it is to get security right even for a large company that uses standard cryptographic techniques to protect a major product.},

	abstract = {  Inspired by the boom of the consumer IoT market, many device manufacturers,
start-up companies and technology giants have jumped into the space.
Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoT, come at the
expense of privacy and security. Industry reports and academic work have
revealed many attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property
loss and large-scale availability problems. To mitigate such threats, a few
solutions have been proposed. However, it is still less clear what are the
impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. In this work, we aim to perform a
comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoT aiming
to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move
forward. To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive
amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related
articles. Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning
technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from
industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them,
the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further
attention. We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT
ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas. We use this
taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we
define. Our assessment reveals that relevant security and privacy problems are
far from solved. We discuss how each proposed solution can be applied to a
problem area and highlight their strengths, assumptions and constraints. We
stress the need for a security framework for IoT vendors and discuss the trend
of shifting security liability to external or centralized entities. We also
identify open research problems and provide suggestions towards a secure IoT
ecosystem.

interconnected devices are deployed just about everywhere, from inside our

every aspect of our lives and will be accessible from anywhere, addressing
critical IoT security threats is now more important than ever. Traditional
approaches where security is applied as an author, title, howpublished, month, year, note afterthought and as a "patch"
against known attacks are insufficient. IoT challenges require a new
secure-by-design vision, where threats are addressed proactively and IoT
devices learn to dynamically adapt to different threats. In this paper, we
first provide a taxonomy and survey the state of the art in IoT security
research, and offer a roadmap of concrete research challenges to address
existing and next-generation IoT security threats.

	abstract = {  In this paper we show how attackers can covertly leak data (e.g., encryption
keys, passwords and files) from highly secure or air-gapped networks via the
row of status LEDs that exists in networking equipment such as LAN switches and
routers. Although it is known that some network equipment emanates optical
signals correlated with the information being processed by the device
('side-channel'), intentionally controlling the status LEDs to carry any type
of data ('covert-channel') has never studied before. A malicious code is
executed on the LAN switch or router, allowing full control of the status LEDs.
Sensitive data can be encoded and modulated over the blinking of the LEDs. The
generated signals can then be recorded by various types of remote cameras and
optical sensors. We provide the technical background on the internal
architecture of switches and routers (at both the hardware and software level)
which enables this type of attack. We also present amplitude and frequency
based modulation and encoding schemas, along with a simple transmission
protocol. We implement a prototype of an exfiltration malware and discuss its
design and implementation. We evaluate this method with a few routers and
different types of LEDs. In addition, we tested various receivers including
remote cameras, security cameras, smartphone cameras, and optical sensors, and
also discuss different detection and prevention countermeasures. Our experiment
shows that sensitive data can be covertly leaked via the status LEDs of
switches and routers at a bit rates of 10 bit/sec to more than 1Kbit/sec per
LED.

	abstract = {  Visible light communication (VLC) systems can provide illumination and
communication simultaneously via light emitting diodes (LEDs). Orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms transmitted in a VLC system
will have high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). Since the transmitting LED
is dynamic-range limited, OFDM signal has to be scaled and biased to avoid
nonlinear distortion. Brightness control is an essential feature for the
illumination function. In this paper, we will analyze the performance of
dynamic range constrained visible light OFDM systems with biasing adjustment
and pulse width modulation (PWM) methods. We will investigate the trade-off
between duty cycle and forward ratio of PWM and find the optimum forward ratio
to maximize the achievable ergodic rates.
