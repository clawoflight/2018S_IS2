We ware able to reproduce the most important finding from Ronen and Shamir~\cite{Ronen:2016:EFAIDCSL} --- Smart LEDs can be used as a covert communication channel.
Specifically, we showed that a light sensor can detect the PWM profile used to dim the LED, allowing a program to distinguish brightness levels that are too close to each other for the human eye to distinguish.

More work is required to make this attack practical, but it is definitely doable even with limited resources.
Given better signal processing, calibration, and a good channel encoding, the full transmission sequence could be automated in a very reasonable time frame.
To make the attack truly practical, better range would be required, for example by putting the light sensor in the focal point of a telescope focused on the light bulb~\cite{Ronen:2016:EFAIDCSL} and maybe using a more sensitive sensor.
That telescope would be the most expensive required piece of hardware by several orders of magnitude.
