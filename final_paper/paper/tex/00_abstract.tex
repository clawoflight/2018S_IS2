\section*{Abstract}

In this paper we attempt to reproduce the initially by Eyal~Ronen and Adi~Shamir~\cite{Ronen:2016:EFAIDCSL} conducted functionality extension attack on IoT light bulbs. This type of attack uses the light bulb's brightness change effect to exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks. We implemented the attack on the widely known Philips Hue White lightning system and were able to proof that those systems are potentially vulnerable to such an covert channel attack. We evaluate our findings with regard to the results of Ronen~and~Shamir and give practicable recommendations.
