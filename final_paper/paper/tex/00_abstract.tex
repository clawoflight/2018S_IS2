\section*{Abstract}

In this paper we attempt to reproduce the functionality extension attack on IoT light bulbs initially conducted by Eyal~Ronen and Adi~Shamir~\cite{Ronen:2016:EFAIDCSL} . This type of attack uses the light bulb's brightness change to exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks. We implemented the attack on the widely known Philips Hue White lightning system and were able to prove that those systems are potentially vulnerable to such a covert channel attack. We evaluate our findings with regard to the results of Ronen~and~Shamir and give practicable recommendations.
