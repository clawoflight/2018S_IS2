\section*{Contribution Statement}
Our overall work repartition was fairly equal.
Bennett spent more time working on the hardware, Arduino, and so on, which Julia compensated by doing more of the initial research and paper structure.
The rest was a mix of hands-on experimentation together, for which we met, and evenly split analysis and writing work which we cross-checked.
