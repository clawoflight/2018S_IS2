\subsection{Attack Description}
\label{sec:exp:description}

With this setup we were able to prove that an attacker can create a covert communication channel by flickering between two light intensities at a very high rate such that the human eye cannot recognize those changes. In the following paragraphs we give a detailed description of how such an attack can be realized. Therefore we need to look more precisely at the functional principle of the communication between light bulbs and controller. Further we have a look at how smooth brightness changes are achieved and how we actually get data out of the received signal.\newline

% TODO - WORK IN PROGRESS
%write about brightness change frequency, why high sampling frequency is needed, Human eye threshold; mention parts in python program ...
